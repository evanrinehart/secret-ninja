a safecopy migration should probably take the following form

type S = S0
data S0 = S0 { }

U S
U S
U S
...
Q S
Q S
Q S
...

ok, and then you change the S

type OldS = S0
type S = S1
data S0 = S0 { }
data S1 = S1 { }

instance Migration S1 where S0 -> S1

U S (edit)
U S (edit)
U S (same)
...
Q S (same)
Q S (same)
Q S (edit)
...
Q OldS (same)

and on bootup, in response to a flag, use Q OldS
to read the old state then migrate the old state
to the new state type then open a new acid state
and write the new state then use the new state

OK, then you can edit the code and reboot like this
remember to disable that flag (wouldnt typecheck anyway)

type S = S1
data S1 = S1 { }

U S
U S
U S
...
Q S
Q S
...
